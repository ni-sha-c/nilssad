## Description

`nilssad` is a package for computing the derivatives of statistically
stationary (or long-time-averaged) observables in a chaotic dynamical
system. This repository is a fork of `qiqi/fds`, which implements the 
[NILSS algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00880.pdf). 
In `nilssad`, finite difference version of NILSS
is implemented using Automatic Differentiation with OpenAD.
